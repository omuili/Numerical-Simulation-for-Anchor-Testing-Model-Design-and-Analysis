## Project Overview

The Anchor Testing Numerical Model is a comprehensive physics-based simulation system designed to evaluate anchor performance in marine environments before physical deployment. This computational model simulates the complex interaction between anchors and different types of seabeds under various environmental conditions.

![System Diagram Placeholder](./images/system_diagram_placeholder.png)

The model incorporates multiple physical domains:
- Soil mechanics (seafloor interaction)
- Hydrodynamics (currents, waves)
- Structural dynamics (chain and anchor mechanics)
- Environmental forces (wind, storms)

By accurately simulating these interactions, the model enables engineers to:
- Evaluate different anchor designs in specific deployment scenarios
- Predict anchor behavior during storms and extreme conditions
- Determine optimal chain length and configuration
- Assess safety factors and performance across seabed types

## Physics & Mathematical Foundation

### Anchor Holding Mechanics

The holding capacity of anchors depends on several factors, modeled as:

```
holding_capacity = max_holding_capacity * angle_factor
max_holding_capacity = anchor_weight * holding_power_factor * seabed_factor
```

Where:
- `angle_factor` accounts for the direction of pull
- `holding_power_factor` is specific to anchor design
- `seabed_factor` varies with seabed material properties

### Environmental Forces

Environmental forces are calculated using standard fluid dynamics equations:

```
Force = 0.5 * density * velocity² * area * drag_coefficient
```

The model accounts for:
- Current forces varying with depth
- Wave-induced oscillatory forces
- Wind forces on the vessel above water

### Chain Mechanics

The anchor chain forms a catenary curve described by:

```
y = a * cosh(x/a)
```

Where tension varies along the length and influences the anchor's setting behavior.

## Software Architecture

The simulation system follows a modular, object-oriented architecture:

### Core Components

1. **`anchor_model.py`** - The physics engine implementing anchor behavior, chain dynamics, and environmental forces

2. **`simulation_runner.py`** - Management of simulation scenarios, parameter sweeps, and comparative analysis

3. **`anchor_visualization.py`** - 2D and 3D visualization tools for result interpretation

4. **`config_loader.py`** - Configuration handling for flexible simulation setup

5. **`main.py`** - Main execution script integrating all components
